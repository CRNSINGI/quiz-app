# How the Quiz App Works:
This quiz application allows users to add multiple-choice questions, with four answer options per question. Upon selecting an answer, the background color of the selected answer will change to indicate correctness:

## Green if the answer is correct.
Red if the answer is incorrect.
Once an answer is selected, it cannot be changed, and the user must proceed to the next question.

### Displaying the Quiz Score:
After submitting the final question and clicking the "Next" button, the app will display the user's total score based on their responses.
